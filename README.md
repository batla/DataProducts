NOAA Storm Data Explorer 1950 - 2011
==================

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and 
economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can 
result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such 
outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

The NOAA Storm Data Explorer allows the user to explor the U.S. National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database from 1950 - 2011

Dataset was downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2). The data was cleaned and aggregated for optimal exploration.

Source code for the application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/batla/DataProducts)
